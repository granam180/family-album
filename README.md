<a href="https://family-album.fly.dev/" target="_blank">Family Album</a> is a *fullstack* website where users can create and review image collections from trips they've taken from either their phone or home computer, along with geotagging by location to be identified on a map. In order to review or create an album of images, you must have an account. This project was part of Colt Steele's web dev course on Udemy to build a Fullstack Campgrounds app.  

## Tech
This project was created using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and Bootstrap. Passport.js was used to handle authentication. Fly.io services for backend deployment.  

## Features
* Users can create, edit, and remove campgrounds
* Users can review campgrounds once, and edit or remove their review
* User profiles include more information on the user (full name, email, phone, join date), their campgrounds, and the option to edit their profile or delete their account
* Search campground by name or location
* Sort campgrounds by highest rating, most reviewed, lowest price, or highest price

## Run it locally
1. Install [mongodb](https://www.mongodb.com/)
2. Create a cloudinary account to get an API key and secret code to store images on their cloud service
3. Create a .env file (or just export manually in the terminal) in the root of the project and add the following:  

```
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=='<name>'
CLOUDINARY_KEY=''<key>
CLOUDINARY_SECRET='<secret>'
```
## Clone

git clone https://github.com/granam180/family-album.git
